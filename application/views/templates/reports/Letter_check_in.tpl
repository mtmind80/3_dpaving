Dear {$clientname},
            <br/><br/>
I hope this letter finds you well. It has now been some time since we wrapped up our work for
{$communityname} at
{$location} in {$city}.
<br/>
I trust that everything went according to plan and that your property is not experiencing any new maintenance issues that need to be addressed.
<br/>
In the event a situation arises that needs to be solved, we would love the opportunity to work with you again, and we are always available to offer a free estimate on a new scope of work.
<br/>
Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me,
<br/><br/>
{$manager} @ 1-855-735-7623 for more information or to set up a meeting!
<br/>
Sincerely,
<br/>
<br/>
{$manager}, {$title}
