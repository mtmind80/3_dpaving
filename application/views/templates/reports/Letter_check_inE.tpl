Dear {$clientname},

I hope this letter finds you well. It has now been some time since we wrapped up our work for
{$communityname} at {$location} in {$city}.

I trust that everything went according to plan and that your property is not experiencing any new maintenance issues that need to be addressed.
In the event a situation arises that needs to be solved, we would love the opportunity to work with you again, and we are always available to offer a free estimate on a new scope of work.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me,

{$manager} @ 1-855-735-7623 for more information or to set up a meeting!

Sincerely,
{$manager}, {$title}
